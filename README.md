Design Pattern Homework

An explanation of what a design pattern is

A design pattern is used to solve problems in software design.  The patterns themselves are reusable solutions for problems.  Reusing the patterns can prevent issues that will cause major problems in the application.
it is almost like a blueprint.

Constructor Pattern
A constructor is a special method that initializes an object once it has been declared.  In JavaScript, everything is an object.  JavaScript doesn’t support classes like Java but it does support constructor functions which are similar.  These work with objects.


Prototype Pattern
A process of cloning.  This pattern creates objects based off of other declared objects.  You could have a main object declared in a constructor pattern and then call the prototype pattern in to manipulate the data within the original function. Say you had an object named Human. Human equals “Harry”, by using the prototype pattern, I can change Harry to Johnny.

Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern fall under the category of creation patterns as they build objects within a program.  It is different from other creational patterns because it doesn’t require the use of a constructor.  The factory can provide its own interface for creating the objects within.  

  
An explanation of why and how the two patterns that you have selected work together.

The 2 patterns I had work together were the constructor patterns and the prototype pattern.  The constructor pattern was essential for creating the objects that I needed to execute the program.  With the constructor pattern I was able to create a function that let me make cats.  With the prototype pattern, I was able to change the names of the cat so it made it look like there was more than one cat present.  I even had a human come into the equation.
